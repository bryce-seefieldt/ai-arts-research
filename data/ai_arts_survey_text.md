## Part 1: Image Classification Task

In this task, you will see 12 images in random order. For each image, classify it as either 'AI-generated' or 'human-created,' and if possible briefly explain your reasoning (e.g., visual features, artistic style).

For each photo (1-12) the subject is asked 
1.1 **How would you classify this image?**
   - [ ] AI-generated
   - [ ] Human-created

1.2 **Please describe the factors (if any) that informed your classification of this image.**  
_Select All That Apply:_
- [ ] Unnatural or inconsistent details (E.g. Extra limbs, odd textures, or distorted features.)
- [ ]  Smoothness or perfection of features (E.g. Overly polished surfaces, perfect symmetry, or uniform lighting.)
- [ ] Perceived artistic intention or emotion (E.g. Deep storytelling, personal expression, or intentional imperfections.)
- [ ] Presence of technical flaws or glitches (E.g. Artifacts, blending issues, or missing elements.)
- [ ] Complexity or detail in the composition (E.g. Elaborate brushstrokes, intricate textures, or layers of meaning.)
- [ ] Familiarity with similar styles or techniques (E.g. A style that resembles AI outputs or a particular human art movement.)
- [ ] Gut instinct or personal impression (E.g. A subjective sense that the work feels either human-made or machine-generated based on overall appearance.)
