#### **Quantitative Analysis**

1. **Perception of AI-Generated Art Originality (Q1 Response)**:
    
    - **Results**:
        - 63.6% (7 participants) believe AI-generated art cannot be considered original.
        - 18.2% (2 participants each) responded "Yes" or "Not Sure"​​.
    - **Age and Creative Artist Status**:
        - Older respondents (>50) showed a higher openness to considering AI-generated art as original compared to younger groups, especially those in the 19–25 age range who were predominantly skeptical​​.
        - Both creative and non-creative artists mostly answered "No," although creative artists showed slightly more openness​​.
2. **Image Classification Task Accuracy**:
    
    - Average accuracy was 78.8% for human-created images and 74.2% for AI-generated ones, showing a slight bias toward better recognition of human-created art​​.
    - Images 2 and 12 had significantly lower accuracy, reflecting confusion due to inherent ambiguities​​.
3. **Demographics**:
    
    - **Age Distribution**: Largest group (36%) aged 19–25; minimal representation from participants aged under 18 or over 50​​.
    - **Creative Artist Status**: 55% identified as creative artists, suggesting a balanced representation​​.
    - **Industry**: Equal distribution across technology and art-related fields, emphasizing diverse perspectives on AI art​.
4. **Ethical and Copyright Concerns (Thematic and Quantitative Responses)**:
    
    - Ethical themes include issues of copyright infringement, training data transparency, and devaluation of human artistry. Many participants highlighted the ability of AI to replicate styles without consent​​.
    - **Compensation Belief**:
        - Artists strongly supported compensation for their work used in AI training (mean: 4.1 out of 5)​.
        - Moderate agreement (mean: 3.5 out of 5) on the notion of AI-generated art as public domain​.
5. **Career Impact**:
    
    - Most respondents rated the career impact of AI-generated art neutrally or slightly negatively (mean: 2.6/5)​​.

#### **Qualitative Analysis**

1. **Common Themes in Responses**:
    
    - AI-generated art is perceived as lacking emotional depth and creative intent, traits tied closely to human artistry​​.
    - Ethical issues revolve around transparency, consent for data use, and preserving the value of human art​.
2. **Opportunities for AI-Generated Art**:
    
    - Positives: Fast prototyping for design, supplementing creative workflows.
    - Negatives: Viewed as potentially replacing human creativity, undermining the uniqueness of art​​.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
    
    - Participants from technology fields expressed a more positive outlook (average sentiment polarity: 0.8) compared to those in arts and design (0.42)​.

#### **Correlations and Trends**

- Participants with higher accuracy in classification tasks rated AI's career impact more positively, potentially due to better familiarity or understanding of the technology​​.
- Creative artists expressed stronger concerns about ethical and copyright issues than non-artists, indicating a direct stake in the implications of AI in their field​.

#### **Recommendations Based on Analysis**

1. **Policy and Advocacy**:
    
    - Introduce clear guidelines for copyright protection and transparent consent for training data to address ethical concerns.
    - Promote policies for compensating artists whose work contributes to AI development.
2. **Educational Outreach**:
    
    - Develop initiatives to educate artists on leveraging AI tools to enhance their creative processes rather than replace them.
3. **Further Research**:
    
    - Explore generational differences in perception and how they influence the integration of AI in the creative industries.

#### **Conclusion**

The study highlights a complex interplay between skepticism, ethical concerns, and the potential utility of AI-generated art. While concerns about originality and ethical use dominate, opportunities exist for AI to support, rather than supplant, human creativity. Continued dialogue and transparent policy-making will be critical in shaping a future where AI and artistry coexist productively.
