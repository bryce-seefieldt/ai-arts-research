"Graphic, web and sound design.","The blurred line copyright will soon have to address to still make people want to make art for public enjoyment. Compensation is important when impersonating an artistâ€™s work and style, as the AI wouldnâ€™t have these data points if it werenâ€™t for the art it was impersonating.

Student,"AI art steals from genuine artists. These images are created by copying real creators art and turning it into a bland representation. AI images are also really easy to create, which will tempt big corporations that do not want to pay for art. When products with AI art are bought, this shows that artist no longer have value. AI generated art can also spread massive misinformation. Many fall victim to seeing these images and believing them without context.",4,5,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
