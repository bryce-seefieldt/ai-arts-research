| Since AI uses collected data to "create" a new image, it could use very exact details from a human's work of art and "copy" it.

| AI art steals from genuine artists. These images are created by copying real creators art and turning it into a bland representation. AI images are also really easy to create, which will tempt big corporations that do not want to pay for art. When products with AI art are bought, this shows that artist no longer have value. AI generated art can also spread massive misinformation. Many fall victim to seeing these images and believing them without context. |           1 | a            |

| The blurred line copyright will soon have to address to still make people want to make art for public enjoyment.

|            3 | I could see the see of AI generated icons and small images for software development, but not very large opportunities.                                                                                            |           1 |
|            4 | I work in IT and I find that this is a great opportunity to create sample/mock art and pictures for us to use in demos.                                                                                           |           1 |
|            5 | I do not because choosing designs or designing anything at my work is not part of my responsibilities.                                                                                                            |           1 |
|            6 | Yes, as a web programmer the use of ai-gernerated art can allow to quickly produce images for storytelling on a webpage.                                                                                          |           1 |
|            7 | I do not see any opportunities to use AI generated art. I believe using any form of AI in artwork is a betrayal to your viewers.                                                                                  |           1 |
|            8 | Nope, I do doc reportage and portraits                                                                                                                                                                            |           1 |
|            9 | Yes, but to improve workflow not to replace an artistâ€™s unique value, thereâ€™s no perfect thing and thatâ€™s what makes art great. Itâ€™s subjective, and art canâ€™t be considered so if itâ€™s standardized. |           1 |

|            1 | The industry will eventually learn to embrace it. New opportunities will open up. Demand for artisanal hand crafted art will remain.                                                                                |           1 |

|            3 | I'm quite negative about AI in the art industry, because art has always been an emotional and "human" thing that I believe should stay a human thing to feel more spiritually and emotionally connected to the art. |           1 |
|            4 | I'm not too involved in this discussion. Though, I do see consequences for many artists with this being used.                                                                                                       |           1 |
|            5 | AI art is entertaining                                                                                                                                                                                              |           1 |
|            6 | AI art is interesting but still needs to be flushed out as there are ethical conundrums that still need to be addressed.                                                                                            |           1 |
|            7 | AI is very harmful towards the art community. Tracers and uncredited artist are already frowned upon, AI art is the worst of both worlds.                                                                           |           1 |
|            8 | Of an artist uses Ai as a tool not a cheat, why not?                                                                                                                                                                |           1 |
|            9 | Can't wait to get to meet AI JESUS, if you don't know look it up. It's real.                                                                                                                                        |           1 |
